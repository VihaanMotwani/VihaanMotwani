I'm a Computer Science student at **Nanyang Technological University, Singapore**, currently partcipating in a exchange program at **University of Maryland, College Park**.
My passion lies at the intersection of AI and business innovation, where I focus on building smart, scalable systems that solve real-world problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently leading development of a **scalable learning platform** featuring a RAG pipeline and agentic workflows[cite: 39].
- ðŸŒ± My core interests include **Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Multi-Agent Systems**[cite: 91, 92].
- ðŸ’¼ I have practical experience developing **multi-agent evaluation pipelines** [cite: 12][cite_start], **GraphRAG systems** [cite: 23][cite_start], and **real-time conversational AI** for voice agents[cite: 28].
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything from **fine-tuning models with LoRA** to **automating ETL with LLMs**.
